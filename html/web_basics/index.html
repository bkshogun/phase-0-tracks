	<h1> Sabrina stop sleeping and fetch me coffee!! </h1> 
		<p> This is the p function... hey what happens if I do "<p>"? Nope that doesn't work </p>
		<strong> Experimental strong </strong>
		<p> <em> EMPHASIS!! Used for actual empahsis, not other italics, such as book titles, etc. </em> </p>
		<ul>
			<li> This is an unordered list I think? </li>
		</ul> 
		<ul> Hence the indent. I wonder how this works...
			<li> Yup, still an unordered list. Nice. </li>
			<li> Hey lets see what this "li" business is all about </li>
			<li> Bulleted list. Nice </li> </ul>
		<ol> I'm a mystery "ol" element
			<il> Hey what's the difference between this and "ul"?</il> </ol>
		<ul> Oh ok, only took me 45 minutes to crack this code: <p>
			<li> Because I'm tired </li>
			<li> Because I'm out of brain juice (coffee) </li> </ul>
		<ol> And just for fun, this should be an ordered list <p>
			<li> Number one </li>
			<li> Number two </li> </ol>
		<a> What does "a" do </a>
		<a> "a" seriously what do you do </a>
		<a> Hmm, well you don't start a new paragraph when I do in Sublime, but that can't be a useful function </a>
				Oh, of course. Anchor. Here, Mets are the best: <p> <p> <ul> <a href="http://www.nymets.com"> Mets official site </a> </ul> </p> </p>
