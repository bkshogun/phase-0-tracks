	<h1> Sabrina stop sleeping and fetch me coffee!! </h1> 
		<p> This is the p function... hey what happens if I do "<p>"? Nope that doesn't work </p>
		<strong> Experimental strong </strong>
		<p> <em> EMPHASIS!! Used for actual emphasis, not other italics, such as book titles, etc. </em> </p>
		<ul>
			<li> This is an unordered list I think? </li> </ul> 
		<ul> 
			<li> Hence the indent. I wonder how this works... </li>
			<li> Yup, still an unordered list. Nice. </li>
			<li> Hey lets see what this "li" business is all about </li>
			<li> Bulleted list. Nice </li> </ul>
		<ol> 
			<li> I'm a mystery "ol" element </li>
			<li> Hey what's the difference between this and "ul"?</li> </ol>
		<ul> 
			<li> Oh ok, only took me 45 minutes to crack this code: </li>
			<li> Because I'm tired </li>
			<li> Because I'm out of brain juice (coffee) </li> </ul>
		<ol> 
			<li> And just for fun, this should be an ordered list </li> 
			<li> Number one </li>
			<li> Number two </li> </ol>
		<a> What does "a" do </a>
		<a> "a" seriously what do you do </a>
		<a> Hmm, well you don't start a new paragraph when I do in Sublime, but that can't be a useful function </a>
