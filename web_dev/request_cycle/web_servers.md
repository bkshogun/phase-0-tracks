I think the main design philospohy of Linux is simplicity and efficiency. It's not fancy, but as one resource said, the programs do one thing and does it well. 

Software leverage is purported as another key tenant, but I think that is an essential part of any language. Simple commands that we use in Ruby, etc, are actually much more complex code written in C, I assume. 

Being open source is huge too, since that makes the code avaliable to everyone to build upon.

A VPS to me sounds like an allocated block, or partition, of a sever that runs independently with a specified amount of memory, computation speed, etc. Linux seems to be a popular choice of operating system, which makes sense since it's small, versitile and powerful. 

Logging in as the root user grants access to important system files that are otherwise unaccessible. Running programs as the root user is inadvisable since it could lead to accidental and irreperable damage to those system files.
