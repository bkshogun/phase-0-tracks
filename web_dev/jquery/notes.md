#1-- find out what jQuery is

Primarily, I find w3schools to be a pretty great resource, as they have simple examples that are interactive. Anything specific, I google and usually end up on stackoverflow. 

I find I learn best by learning a little bit, testing it by running examples, and repeating that until I can put all the pieces together to create something more substantial 

Breaks are very important, and something I have not been able to properly integrate in my studying. Too often I stare at the same code for hours and accomplish nothing. Taking a break and coming back with fresh eyes is very beneficial.



The project I wrote is very simple, and short because jQuery and mostly JavaScript was giving me a headache. I don't get it... so much random syntax. Ruby is much more readable and intuitive, in my opinon.
