# an encrypt method that advances every letter of a string one letter forward: we would first have
# to define a variable, and establish a counter so we don't create an infinite loop. Calling the
# index function "[]" on the variable will return the first letter of the variable, and incrementing
# the counter as the index argument will call the next letter in the string. Implementing the .next
# method on the string will call the subsequent letter in the alphabet. This isn't psuedo coding, is
# it.

# to decrypt the string, we'd have to essentially take each letter of the string and return the
# prior letter of the alphabet for each. To do this, I'll have to find a way to convert each letter
# of the given string to an integer, and subtract one from that integer, and then convert that
# integer back to the coresponding letter in the string. It looks like this can be done with a
# combination of the .ord and .chr functions

# Release 5- Add An Interface: asking the user to encrypt or decrypt a password, used "gets" and run
# some comparison code. User enters password as a string, would be saved as a variable. The proper
# encrypt or decrypt method would be called, performing the requested operation before exiting.

# decrypt(encrypt("swordfish")) on line 42 does not work, and I'm not entirely sure why. Because the
# encrypt method is called withing parenthesis, that should be evaluated first. When it is encoded
# and returned as an encoded string as an argument to the decrypt method, that method should be
# called on it and thus decoded back to "swordfish". My guess is that the encrypt function is merely
# printing, not necessarily returning a value.
